# JPL Intranet

All things JPL intranet.
As components are re-written, we'll add them here.

The new application is written using React, Typescript, TailwindCSS, and Vite.

## Development

To get started, navigate to `/app` and start the dev server.

```shell
cd app
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The application should now be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
